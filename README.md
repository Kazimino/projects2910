  WELCOME TO REACTOR  README 
==========================
*******************************
WHAT IS REACTOR? 
============

Reactor is a multitasking brain game that 
allows you to manage multiple modules.
The goal is to stop the reactor from melting 
down by solving the mini-game inside 
each module that is presented to you.  THere 
is a heat guage for each module, if 
the heat guage for an individual module 
gets full, your main heat bar will increase 
at an accelerated rate.  You want to mitigate 
the heat being passed on to the main heat bar 
by promptly solving each puzzle presented to you. 

THere is some "coolant" which counter acts the 
heat however it is set quite low right now and 
you will only see the effect of it when there are no active 
games.  

We have a leaderboard for the top times.
